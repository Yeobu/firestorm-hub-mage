# Firestorm Hub

This is the repository with the open-source code used for the website [Firestorm-Hub](https://firestorm-hub.com).

## Add you own guide ?

If you're interested in participating by writing a guide for your own spec ? You can contact me on discord : rise_of_elements.

## The Website

To build this website, I used Typescript, React, and TailwindCSS. Most of the components were made from scratch. I used :

- [Material Tailwind](https://www.material-tailwind.com/docs/react/select) for its Select component (used in the right menu in the guides).
- [React Custom Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-custom-scroll) for any scrollbars (cause fuck default scrollbars).
- [React tooltip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tooltip) for some tooltips. I might drop it cause it feels wanky at times.
- [WowHead Tooltips](https://www.wowhead.com/tooltips) to display blizzard-like tooltips very easily.

If you have any question, don't hesitate to contact me on discord (rise_of_elements), I am always very happy to discuss any topics !

## Install locally

If you want to install and run the website locally, you will need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en). Once you cloned the repository, in your terminal navigate to the root folder and use the command : `npm i` to install all the dependancies.

To start the local server, use the command `npm run dev` and go to the local URL given.
